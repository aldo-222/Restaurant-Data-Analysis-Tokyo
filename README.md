# Discoveries in a restaurant in Tokyo: What the consumption data reveals 
## Summary

### Tacos: The commercial axis in the restaurant
![Scatter plot - overview](images/overview.png)
Tacos are the top-selling individual product, both at lunch and dinner, in terms of units sold and total revenue. Quesadillas and burritos follow in third and fourth place, respectively. This data will be visualized in the next graph to identify relationhips.

If we rank products by sales performance (from highest to lowest), we will find that the top 33% account for 80% of sales.
A clear strategy is to push the sales of the top 5, so we can bias to get the 20% - 80% relation.
What about the rest of the products? Let's take a look:
